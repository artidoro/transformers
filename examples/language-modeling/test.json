There has been news circulating on social media that the team of \"Filhall\" is looking for a fresh pair for the song's sequel.\nAkshay, 52, took to Twitter to put an end to the speculation.\n\"I have heard a lot of fake news during coronavirus pandemic but now fake casting is also happening. #Filhall yeh padhiye#FakeNewsAlert #FakeCastingAlert,\" he tweeted.\nThe actor also shared a notice to clarify that his production house hasn't authorised any agency to cast for \"Filhall 2\".\n\"For all the 'Filhall' fans out there!

        "gpt2_output": "Superstar Akshay Kumar on Saturday debunked rumours about fresh casting for the follow up of his hit film, Kick. Kumar has shared his thoughts about the rumours, saying they are spreading rumours for attention sake.\n\nWhile talking about the rumour about a new actor joining the film, he had said, \"This (rumour) is being repeated by many so-called film critics, who only know how to spread rumours. All these are rumours which are being used to gain popularity. Even when I said this to them, they refused to listen to me. I will not entertain rumours anymore, and only address those who have the guts to talk sense.\"\n\nKumar added, \"All these rumours are being spread by certain persons who only know only how to spread such rumours. I know that they want to gain publicity through spreading rumours. I am addressing all the rumours with an open mind. I will only address a particular question if I find it to be true.\"\n\nThe Star Plus actor further added, \"I am not taking sides and am taking only a stand on rumours which are used only for the sake of attention.\"\n\n\"It's not something which will harm the film. I am taking a stand only on rumours which I feel are being used for publicity and attention. I am not taking any sides in this matter,\" he added.\n\nThe actor said he has to prove the critics wrong and prove them wrong. \"If I have to prove them wrong, I have to make the film so that the critics will be wrong. Once the critics believe in me, I will prove them wrong.\"\n\nIn August, Star Plus had launched their website which featured an article about the casting of actors for the film. The article claimed that Priyanka Chopra would be portraying the role of a girl named Neelu while Rani Mukherjee would be playing Neelu's friend named Priya. However, actor Akshay had immediately sent a message to Star Plus and said that his mother had suggested that Priyank Chopra will be playing Neeli.\n\nAkshay further said that the article was just made to gain attention, and adding that he does not mind sharing his mother's suggestions about the character and what he wants to portray in the film.\n\n'I have no idea if Akshay is taking this seriously'\n\nIt was recently reported that Akshay would take on a new role for his next film, Kick in which Rani Mukerjee will be seen as a female character called Neeli. However, this report has come from the same person who had earlier also wrote about Priyanka as a new character called Neelu.\n\nIn the article, the writer said that Priyanca was being called Neelua and Rani was being called as Neelu, and then added that Akshara will be playing as her friend Priyanka. In his interview, Akshay said, \"The rumour is spreading that Neelu is from Priyanka's character, and I am not really aware about this. I really want to deny the rumour and find out the truth. What is the point in denying it? I am taking this so seriously that I do not know if Akshara is taking this really seriously. Maybe he is going by what his mother has suggested in her wish list about him being in the film.\"\n\nAmitabh Bachchan is set to play a role in a film starring Akshay, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Priyanka, but the actor is not sure about the storyline for the film and has no idea if his character will be a romantic interest for one of the women. Speaking to India Today, Bachchan said, \"I can't really tell you anything because it's a film for the children of our generation and they are asking for good stories. We just want to entertain them. I haven't heard anything concrete about the film. We are still figuring out the details. I just want to do this film and tell the audience that they will get a new hero like Akshay.\"\n\nIt's been long since we saw Akshay acting in a heroine-centric film, and now his next film is expected to have a very interesting plot and a lot of twists and turns along the way. The upcoming film is directed by Shailesh. The actor will be seen playing a very interesting character for the film, which may also see Priyanka playing a very important role.\n\nAccording to our sources, Shailesh has chosen to have a strong heroine character for the movie, which will be played by Priyanka and Amitabh Bachcha who has been signed up for the film which is scheduled to release this coming December 28. The other actor playing a hero is Amitabh who will be playing a father type character.\n\nMeanwhile, another good thing for both the actors and the makers of Kick that Priyaja has agreed to play a very important and important role in this film. Now we wonder what role Priyanka will play in the film, but our sources say that Priyaj will play a very very good and very important character in this movie.\n\nThis is the second role in the film where Priyanka would play an important role in a romantic drama. However, it is yet to be confirmed. Akshay's new film Kick is expected to release in November and in the meantime watch our video for more details about this latest film by Akshay.\n\n\"I have made it a point to not do any such thing (give out personal info of his fans) on my Twitter account,\" Akshay told the press while explaining why he did not respond to an Indian Express reporter's query when he was asked about his relationship with actress Sharmila Tagore.\n\nTagore, who is also a former beauty queen, recently filed a complaint of stalking after which she accused the actor of calling her and sending her texts about the beauty pageant he has won. After the police probed the matter, Tagore said that she received two-hundred-four text messages in a span of two months.\n\nShe also claimed that the messages came from unknown numbers and that she couldn't figure out the sender's location.\n\nSo much to say\n\nAfter giving the press a week's time to respond to the story, Akshara announced he would give an exclusive interview and give an official response, while adding that he was sure that he will be questioned by the media because it was a very serious matter.\n\nHe said: \"I am sure that when I talk to the media that I will also be asked questions on the reasons for my silence and why did I do not disclose my relationship. I don't want this to look like a publicity stunt to get even more fans. This is not about Sharmila. I have given my fans enough of my time on Twitter. I have a lot of friends and acquaintances and don't want anything to affect the friendship between me and my fans.\"\n\nBut, at the same time, there have been questions on the basis of which he never responded to a reporter's question.\n\nOne of the questions was who he told about his relationship before Sharmila was told about it. While he claims it was not a secret, we can't seem to verify his claims. The reason for the delay in disclosing his relationship with the actress is because of the reasons why he does not talk about his personal life.\n\nThere are plenty of questions regarding his personal life that he is not willing to answer, but one of his best answers to the queries was the reason he didn't respond to Sharmila's request because he was not comfortable doing it and didn't want to reveal details about his relationship that he doesn't want his fans to know.\n\nAfter announcing that he didn't want his privacy to be compromised, he has now clarified that he does have a public persona and it is his job to speak about it on social media. However, he had a reason for not doing so, and his answer to Sharmla's request was that he was concerned about the privacy of his fans.\n\nWhat Akshay says is his truth\n\nBut that doesn't mean that we need to accept everything he says just because he says it is his truth. He does not say everything and we have to take the same with a pinch of salt.\n\nBut this is the reason why we still have to verify his statements on social media and if he is telling the truth.\n\nI have already asked a number of Akshay fanatics and they are saying that they are more than satisfied with the way he handled this whole situation and they don't want to believe that he didn\u2019t say that he didn not give any information to Sharmil.\n\nThey are still waiting for the official response from Akshara and when that will be there, we will know where Akshay stand.\n\nIf he is telling his truth, he should be given a free pass to speak his mind on social media, as he does. That is his right, why does Akshay need to explain to us his reasons for not responding and explaining the truth in his answer?\n\nIf not, why not?\n\nI would like to believe that Aksh is truthful when he claims that he is very open and honest with his fans, and that it would have been better if he answered our questions. I believe Aksh has a very strong reason for not giving us any information.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this whole situation is dragging on and there is a big gap between the fans and Aksh, who had a great response from us regarding the recent social media storm and the reasons behind it.\n\nWe still don't have the official statement from Aksh, and this"

        "text": " No. 3 Tennessee trounces Georgia 96-50 to open SEC play \nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee is creating quite a home-court advantage at an arena it had trouble filling in the past.\nJordan Bowden scored 20 points off the bench as the third-ranked Volunteers opened Southeastern Conference competition by trouncing Georgia 96-50 on Saturday for their eighth consecutive overall and 17th straight home win.\nTennessee (12-1, 1-0 SEC) hasn't lost a home game in a full calendar year. The Vols' last home defeat was a 94-84 setback against Auburn on Jan. 2, 2018.\n\"You can't take it for granted,\" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. \"You just can't think because you play at home, you can walk out and it's going to happen. The fact is, these guys have worked hard and they've just grown as a team. Winning at home has been a byproduct of that, obviously.\"\nTennessee recorded the most lopsided triumph in this series' 156-game history, surpassing a 105-69 Volunteers victory from Feb. 1, 1975.\nThe Vols were one point away from matching their most decisive win over any SEC opponent. Tennessee beat Mississippi 102-55 on Jan. 8, 1966.\n\"I'm more disappointed in our competitive level, and the fact I'm not really sure what we made them earn today,\" Georgia coach Tom Crean said. \"They made a lot of shots. They made a lot of plays. I'm not sure how much we contested those things. We've got a long way to go in a short time.\"\nTennessee's blowout delighted a sellout crowd of 21,678 at Thompson-Boling Arena - the first of five announced home sellouts for the 2018-19 season at college basketball's fifth-largest home arena. Tennessee athletic department spokesman Tom Satkowiak says it's believed this is the first time the Vols have sold out as many as five home games since Thompson-Boling Arena opened in 1987.\nThe Vols gave those fans plenty to cheer. Tennessee never trailed all day and led by as many as 49 points.\n\"It's a dream come true for me,\" said Bowden, a Knoxville resident. \"When I was younger, coming to all the games, seeing the atmosphere and (now) being a part of it, it's really big.\"\nGrant Williams and Admiral Schofield scored 18 points each for Tennessee. Kyle Alexander had 12 points and 14 rebounds, and Jordan Bone added 11 points.\nDerek Ogbeide scored 17 points for Georgia (8-5, 0-1), which had a three-game winning streak snapped.\nFoul trouble doomed the Bulldogs.\nOgbeide had his big game despite picking up two fouls in the first 57 seconds. Rayshaun Hammonds, who entered the day averaging a team-high 15 points, picked up three fouls in the first 14 minutes and ended up scoreless.\nNicolas Claxton, who had been averaging a double-double for Georgia, committed four fouls in the first half and finished with six points and five rebounds. Crean said he tried removing Claxton after the third foul but couldn't make a substitution before a fourth foul was called as well.\n\"You get into a game like this and you're down like that, you've got to play through things, but we certainly wanted to get him out,\" Crean said. \"The whistle didn't stop (play) until unfortunately he got his fourth foul.\"\nBIG PICTURE\nGeorgia: The Bulldogs couldn't do much of anything against Tennessee's defence. The Bulldogs shot a season-low 32.1 per cent (17 of 53) and were 1 of 20 from 3-point range.\nTennessee: The Vols are off to their best start since winning 16 of their first 17 games in 2007-08. That team went on to earn a No. 1 ranking later that year before finishing 31-5 with an NCAA regional semifinal appearance.\nTURNER RETURNS\nTennessee's Lamonte' Turner returned to action Saturday after missing the Vols' last six games with a shoulder injury. He played 15 minutes and scored six points.\nTurner averaged 10.9 points and was named the SEC's co-sixth man of the year last season.\n\"We've been pretty good, but we can't get to our full potential without him,\" Barnes said.\nMODEL OF EFFICIENCY\nWilliams needed just five field-goal attempts to score his 18 points. He made his only 3-point attempt, went 3 of 4 from inside the arc and was 9 of 11 on free throws. Williams also had eight rebounds and five assists.\nQUOTABLE\n\"We ran like we were wearing 50-pound weights on our shoulders,\" Crean said.\nUP NEXT\nGeorgia hosts Vanderbilt on Wednesday.\nTennessee visits Missouri on Tuesday.\n----\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP-Top25"

        "text": "In today's world, with numerous nation-state and ethnic confrontations and with planetary problems like climate change and pandemics, the real conflict should not be between opposing political systems but rather between the forces of modernity, competence and development on the one hand, and those of ignorance, exploitation and oppression on the other. By this calculus, China and the US should be sitting on the same side of the table. But this is why the cascading free fall in US-China relations is so counterproductive. Is all the US' unnuanced negativity about China furthering long-term American interests? Of course not. But then neither are the anti-American unnuanced pronouncements of Chinese officials furthering Chinese interests. There is a vicious cycle between American and Chinese mutual attacks, each amplifying the other in a race to the bottom. I have long maintained that the peace and prosperity of the entire world are related directly to the bilateral relations between the US and China. I know leaders, officials and experts in both China and the US, and the large majority are highly educated, highly competent, professionally sophisticated, and morally upright. How then the dramatic opposing views? I advocate being candid, with each side stating to the other side what it really believes. I can recite the stereotypical views of anti-Chinese Americans and anti-American Chinese, but none of this, I suggest, neither Chinese nor American stereotypical views, is the deep reason for US-China tensions. The deep reason, on both sides, is nationalism, which features in all societies and all social systems. Nationalism is rooted in biological evolution, where early human allegiance to the group and the tribe, increased fitness for survival and procreation in the development of our species. Human beings have confirmed over and over again that they will bear any hardship, endure any pain, to protect the sanctity and pride of the group, which today is usually the nation-state or specific ethnicities. I am always amazed how intelligent folk can so easily see the counter-productivity of misguided nationalism when viewing dispassionately the behaviors of others, while they are so easily blinded in not discerning the same misguided nationalism in their own, similar passions. Notwithstanding real issues on both sides, simplistic bias and one-dimensional stereotyping, driven by nationalism on both sides, is a recipe for confrontation, not cooperation. But to recognize and expose nationalism is to cool its passions and reduce its power, allowing rational forces on both sides to build trust. We have indeed entered a period of \"struggle\" between China and the US, though I would hesitate to call it an \"ideological struggle.\" For example, issues of sovereignty and territoriality, for all countries, are drivers of foreign policy irrespective of political ideology. This is similar for espionage, cyber and other forms. Nationalism transcends ideology. There are multiple, tortuous issues between China and the US. But if I have to pick, at this moment, the most insidious, it would be one on each side. In the US, some call for the CPC to be removed from power, a direct interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, and in China, some would seek to control information and influence discourse in other countries via economic and diplomatic pressures and other means. These two ways of thinking feed on each, in a vicious cycle of escalation. The more China senses that the US wants to overthrow its socialist, CPC-led political system, the more it will try to influence US and Western discourse. And the more the US senses that China wants to control information beyond its borders, the more the US will seek to change the system. The US should come to recognize the benefits for China of China's CPC-led system; poverty alleviation and pandemic control, as well as economic development, are evidence. For its part, China should come to have more confidence in the success of its system and not react sharply to every perceived criticism from beyond its borders. The challenge for the US is to avoid threatening China's core interests, especially Party leadership and Taiwan. The challenge for China is to reduce the anxiety of those who fear China's rise, especially of those who accused China of restricting information and constraining freedoms of non-Chinese. Political wisdom is needed for avoiding further exacerbation and escalation, which would only harm both countries and the world as a whole. Nothing would be better for the American and Chinese peoples, indeed for all people, than genuine cooperation between the US and China. I'm watching for wisdom. Granted, China's relations with much of the developed world are undergoing change. It may sound paradoxical, but I view these changes as a special opportunity for China to emerge as a champion of the global good, even beyond the fact that it is already the largest trading nation with most countries. Because China's image is often portrayed in the international media in a simplistic, antagonistic, homogeneous, self-aggrandizing manner, China's actions for the global good, such as supplying vaccines to less developed countries, become both surprising and appreciated, undermining stereotypes and catalyzing rethinking. China's leaders assert that, in an integrated global economy, China's stability and development is essential for world peace and prosperity. The CPC-led political system, they insist, is essential for maintaining such stability and development, from which the world benefits - from 5G technology to containing epidemics to alleviating poverty. China and the US, working together, should become bulwarks of peace and engines of prosperity, which would benefit both peoples and all humanity.

        "text": "Japanese pianist Yuhki Kuramoto poses in this undated photo. Courtesy of Yuhki Kuramoto\nBy Park Ji-won\nJapanese new age pianist and composer Yuhki Kuramoto says his difficult past didn't bring him down, but rather helped him find his passion for music.\n\"When I was a teenager, it was difficult to continue practicing piano as I had no piano at home (because my parents went bankrupt,)\" Kuramoto, one of the most renowned pianists, told The Korea Times in a recent email interview.\n\"However, while playing the cello, I was able to play the piano on behalf of harp as a member of school orchestra in my middle and high schools... I learned how to play the piano with other musical instruments there which was lucky for me to learn the ensemble being surrounded by good friends and a teacher.\"\nKuramoto became famous among Koreans in the 1990s when the Korean government lifted its ban on Japanese cultural content. His music started to be used in various TV commercials and his nature-inspired soft and melodic sound resonated with many Koreans. Since then, he has participated in various composition projects with Korean media, and visits here more than five times a year for concerts.\nHis success, however, didn't come overnight. He didn't go to music school and ended up studying applied physics at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, one of the most prestigious universities in Japan, as he thought he would not be able to make money out of music.\nHowever, he didn't give up playing the piano, spending countless nights practicing at the university. He dreamed to become a pianist.\n\"There was a piano in the university which was for the student orchestra and chorus. I played the piano as much as I could. It is not something advisable, but I missed many classes to play the piano. (Sometimes I started practicing at 9 a.m. and finished at 5 p.m.) I did so because I was purely motivated by the self-determination that I want to become a better pianist.\"\nStudying physics, however, wasn't a waste of time, but it was a detour to his current career, he recalls.\n\"Music was one of my hobbies before getting into the university. My knowledge of physics is helping me understand instruments and harmony. And my knowledge of electronics is helping me understand recording and synthesizers. But spending a lot of time studying them was a detour to my music career.\"\nHe was able to make money out of playing popular music in his first year at university and bought his own piano. Juggling two jobs as a physicist and pianist for a while, he decided to become a full-time musician and became actively engaged in composing music.\nKuramoto maintains his enthusiasm for his musical professional, spending most of his time composing or arranging and playing his music while being inspired by various things such as classical music and traveling.\n\"I spend most of my time composing and arranging new music and playing my music. But I spend more time on the arrangement before concerts... Above all, I was inspired by classical music. Not only did I listen to it, but also I played and analyzed it. Because I am not a machine, I also create some time to fill my soul with nutrition. I get inspiration while travelling or walking in nature. I also think it is good to go to a random street and watch movies, performances and reading books... Sometime I play jazz to get inspired.\"\nHe pledged to remain trying to heal people with his new age music.\n\"Music becomes meaningful when people listen to it. In the future, I will continue to make new albums and hold concerts in various places. My music is soft and calm, so I hope many people will be able to heal their lives through it."

It's desperately sad and it's such an insult to all of us who are democratic citizens who believe in inclusion and equality,\" she said.\nThe red and black flag resembles a Wehrmacht flag, which was used between 1935 and 1938 to represent the armed forces of Nazi Germany.\nIt was replaced by another flag when Adolf Hitler became the commander-in-chief of the armed forces in 1938.\nMs Holmes said the flag had shocked residents in Beulah, which she described as a kind and welcoming community.\nThe ABC has attempted to contact the residents of the house, but has not received a response.\nHowever, The Age newspaper reported one of the residents defended flying the flag above the home, citing her German ancestry.\nGovernment reviewing 'gaps' in vilification laws\nA parliamentary inquiry is reviewing Victoria's anti-vilification laws after Reason Party MP Fiona Patten proposed amendments to extend the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act.\nThe issues in the bill have been referred to the Legal and Social Issues Committee.\nAustralian Anti-Defamation Commission chair Dvir Abramovich has been calling on the Victorian Government to ban the display of Nazi memorabilia and flags.\n\"It's not illegal and that's where the problem lies,\" Dr Abramovich told ABC Radio Melbourne.\n\"They are using the swastika as a rallying cry to celebrate the murderous legacy of the Third Reich, and they have the law on their side.\n\"Anyone who loves this country and believes in the core values that binds us together, of respect and freedoms, would be horrified.\"\nMr Andrews said the Government had met with Jewish groups and would make a submission to the inquiry focused on a recent increase in anti-Semitic behaviour .\n\"Anti-Semitism is on the rise. That is a fact,\" he said.\n\"It is completely unacceptable for anyone to be flying what is perhaps the ultimate symbol of hate and that is that flag. It is just disgusting behaviour. Nothing justifies that behaviour whatsoever.\"\nHe said he hoped the inquiry would give the Government a path forward to deal with any \"gaps\" in the law."

        "text": "Grief is possibly the most personal and lonely of all emotions. In sharing it, one fears losing its depth that you want to preserve forever. But after reading all the tributes to Isher Ahluwalia, I feel compelled to bring forward essential components of her persona. All that has been written about her professional achievements, her determined academic adventures starting from a financially challenged background to scoring all her goals, is an important message for today's youth in similar predicament. That story cannot be shared enough. But, for those who had the privilege of knowing her personally, what she brought to her relationships will remain as the most indelible, extraordinary part of her.\nAhluwalia was a woman's woman. A true feminist does not compete with men. Yet, the camaraderie she shared with women was rich and fulfilling. Notwithstanding her breaking the glass ceilings in the bastioned macho world of economists, Ahluwalia enjoyed and revelled in what can be called \"feminine\" areas. Despite being a high achieving working woman, her focus on motherhood was as crucial to her as her profession. We were of the generation when the bulk of parenting was the responsibility of the mother. And, there was great joy and humour in it. Keeping in mind her formidable intellect and the usual political discussions, there was a side to her where she was as enthusiastic in talking about parenting, grandchildren, sarees, and yes, hair. She was determined to look her best through her radiation treatments and planned her African themed turbans and caps. She turned to her love of Hindustani classical music and Gurbani while recovering from tough cancer treatments. She was a magnet to young professional women. It was no surprise to me that a young dentist has a wall with Ahluwalia's article clippings in her clinic dedicated to her. She told me that Ahluwalia was like a mother to her.\nOur relationship then spanned three generations when our children then grandchildren became friends. Ahluwalia would take the little ones for a meal to the India International Centre and paid as much attention to their views on subjects as she would to serious intellectuals. She spent valuable time with her grandchildren and often included mine. She mentioned the joy she felt when my granddaughter called her \"dadi\". At one of the grandchildren's birthday parties, she roundly ticked off a magician, who in the midst of his magic show, blithely made a comment about girls that she deemed as sexist. Even many feminists would have simply ignored it to keep a \"happy\" atmosphere at a kid's birthday party. Not her. She roundly educated that hapless magician. Her grandchildren will grow up with her unmistakable influence even though she may not be physically present.\nWhen her son was getting married, she told me how delighted she was to have another woman in her house after living with her brood of three men. Ahluwalia invested in her relationships. It is not by accident that her list of friends is long and deep, spanning around the world. Despite debilitating treatments, she travelled with her husband to other cities for his book events. She was determined to experience every moment to its fullest despite the challenges of being in the midst of treatment. In Delhi, in February this year, she was the undisputed star at her husband's book launch, her bravery outshining all of the political and economic discourse. After the book launch, friends joined them at their home for dinner. There, I went into shame-faced shock when she had her husband read out, in public, three pages she had written about me. It was totally undeserved. She saw more in you than you really were.\nX\nX\nLIVE\nAn error occurred. Please try again later\nX\nTap to unmute\nLearn more\nAdvertisement\nAhluwalia loved being a woman. I do believe, that her articles about water conservation, sanitation, waste management, though based on a foundation of economic research, were always solution oriented and that to me, is intrinsically feminine. She connected with other women because she loved the feminine in herself and in other women. She totally got the rolling of the eyes we women do when we say, \"Men\"! She genuinely celebrated the success of other women. She loved that the new normal was that women worked and were great mothers. She was delighted that today's young women could take for granted what our generation had to fight for. I don't recall her ever extolling \"what we had to go through\". She simply rejoiced in the present.\nIsher knew she was leaving this world. She called me to talk about her book. It is my favourite memory, that I spontaneously and now I think appropriately, sat on the carpet at her feet as she narrated her life story to me. She decided she was going to finish her autobiography, courageously pulling it together despite extreme health challenges. By gifting her book to the world, she bequeathed her strength to all those who loved her to hang on to. A woman's woman. Isher was that. Tat Tvam Asi. Thou art that.\nThe writer is a journalist"

        "text": "As spring kicks in, honey researchers are stepping up their efforts to study how native trees can increase the value of honey that has healing properties.\nManuka honey is known for its medicinal and healing qualities, with New Zealand product currently dominating the lucrative market.\nThe honey is produced with the pollen from Leptospermum tree species. New Zealand only has two of these species, but Australia has about 86.\nProfessor Liz Harry from the ithree institute, at the University of Technology Sydney, wants Australian beekeepers to send her samples of their honey.\nIt is part of a research project that aims to establish which Australian species of Leptospermum produce honey with high antibacterial qualities to rival new Zealand's Manuka product.\n\"On the Sunshine Coast, in Queensland, there is quite a lot of Leptospermum species, and it is very potent in killing bacteria and has similar chemical properties to the New Zealand Manuka honey,\" Ms Harry said.\n\"That has been unrealised and unpublished for a long time.\n\"Australia has 86 species of Leptospermum that we know of and New Zealand only has two species of two, but we have a lot more land.\n\"We should be reaping the benefits of Manuka honey, for farmers, beekeepers and for the medical solution it delivers.\"\nManuka honey sells for up to $40 per kilogram, and in New Zealand is worth an estimated $75 million a year, so the value of it in Australia could be considerably higher given the diversity of Leptospermum species.\nMs Harry wants samples of honey from beekeepers all over Australia, not just Queensland, to help determine how potent Australian-made Manuka can be.\n\"Although there is a great enrichment of Leptospermum on the Sunshine Coast, we are looking all around Australia,\" she said.\n\"We have been out there, letting beekeepers know about the study, which is funded by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation.\"\nThe study is also being funded by Australia's largest honey producer, Capilano Honey, which recently completed a multimillion dollar takeover of Australian-based Manuka honey producer, KirksBees.\nMedicinal honey producer, Comvita, which currently produces its Manuka honey using Leptospermum species in New Zealand, is also helping to finance the project.\nMs Harry said the study would also help understand how different types of Leptospermum trees could be used to make different honeys with varying medical applications.\n\"I think what we will find is that there might be properties of one species of Leptospermum species that are superior for some uses than another species of leptospermum,\" she said.\n\"This is just about finding what species of Leptospermum are better for certain things.\"\nMs Harry said as the public became more aware of the medicinal properties in honey, the price of honey will rise for producers.\n\"All honey is anti-bactericidal, so not only will the value of Leptospermum species of honey increase, but the value of all honeys will increase because of public perception,\" she said.\n\"That is what is happening in New Zealand, all the honey there has increased [in price], so the world is really interested in New Zealand and Australia for our pure products.\"\nHowever, Ms Harry said Australia is better positioned than New Zealand to expand the Manuka honey trade.\n\"Australia doesn't suffer from a syndrome called colony collapse disorder (CCD), which causes bees in their hives to die overnight all at once,\" she said.\n\"We don't know what causes it, but we know Australia doesn't suffer it, and it also doesn't suffer from an infectious pathogen already in New Zealand.\n\"So we have an advantage to sell our honey at premium prices and also to find out more about how honeybees might be dying, by using Australia as an example of where we don't have [these disorders] and comparing it with countries that do.\"\nMs Harry said so far she has received honey samples from beekeepers in Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania , Western Australia and South Australia.\n\"We are getting the honey from wherever people can send it,\" she said.\nHoney Bee & Pollination R&D Program spokesperson, Ben Hooper, said early results from honey collected in New South Wales already showed similar qualities to New Zealand's Manuka honey.\n\"Initial findings from the North Coast and Northern Rivers regions of New South Wales have confirmed Australian honey is just as potent as the Manuka from New Zealand, which is an incredible boom for the industry in areas where the trees grow,\" Mr Hooper said.\n\"The next step is to identify more sources of these types of honey, which is why researchers will be travelling the country with beekeepers over coming months to collect nectar, plant and honey samples.\"\nBeekeepers interested in providing samples for testing should contact the project coordinator, Dr Nural Cokcetin at the University of Technology Sydney.\nThe project is also being supported by the University of Sydney and the University of the Sunshine Coast."

        "text": "By Brother Anthony, Jung Ha-yun and Min Eun-kyung\nBrother Anthony, professor emeritus at Sogang University / Korea Times file\nIn recent years our expectations as judges for the Modern Korean Literature Translation Awards have been elevated due to the rising quality of the submitted works. We are happy to report that this year's entries once again did not disappoint. Especially notable were the high proficiency of English demonstrated by the contestants and their discerning taste in serious contemporary Korean literature. \nThe overall excellence in the readability of the translations demanded close comparison of the entries with their original Korean works, which made the final decisions in both the poetry and fiction/drama categories quite difficult. \nAccuracy in literary translation refers to fidelity not only in meaning but in aesthetics, from narrative craft and style to imagery and lyricism. This requires in the translator, in addition to linguistic proficiency, a willingness for deep artistic engagement with the original work and for experimentation in language. \nJung Ha-yun, professor at Ewha Womans University\nIn poetry this year, the applicants took on works by diverse poets, from Lee Hae-in and Huh Su-kyung to Hwang Byung-sng and Park Jun. While the poems of less conventional voices like Hwang and Park posed bigger challenges for the translators in terms of form, the more familiar works demanded a more polished lyrical rendering in English. \nIn the end, the entry that stood out for us was the translation of poems by Kim Ki-taek, which demonstrated coherence in the interpretation of Kim's works and convincing control of the poetic language while not veering too far from the understated tone and voice of the original. We should note that while the entry contained its share of mistranslations and misreadings, we concluded that its merits were more significant than its mistakes. We do hope the Grand Prize will encourage the translator to revise and polish the manuscript for future publication. \nMin Eun-kyung , professor at Seoul National University\nThe fiction/drama category posed a more heated debate among the judges as in previous years. The textual density of a modern short story presents an exhausting series of obstacles for the beginning translator and its thematic complexity requires contemplation and courage as well. \nAmong this year's entries, the translations of two stories, \"The Other Side\" and \"A Covering Hand,\" both by Kim Ae-ran, were our final considerations. Both were transferred into English in engaging and expressive prose, which allowed for the narrative strength of Kim's stories to shine, and both managed to achieve this while staying faithful to the original text in meaning and style. At the same time, both shared similar shortcomings, in which the transfer into English of some of the Korean sentences seemed incomplete and would sound too unfamiliar, or at times incomprehensible to an English readership. \nAfter much comparison and deliberation, we decided on the translation of \"A Covering Hand\" as the winner of the Grand Prize, for its overall narrative strength and interpretive consistency. This story of a single mother raising a racially mixed teenage son offers a compelling portrayal of everyday life in small-town Korea with villagers aging in poverty and juveniles tempted by danger and violence. The translation successfully takes on the universal themes of family, nurturing, and cultural differences explored in the original text. \nThis year's Commendation Prize goes to the translation of \"The Other Side,\" which, in addition to the merits mentioned above, exhibited poetic flair in several passages that exquisitely captured the lyricism and resonance in Kim's use of language. \nOur congratulations go to the Grand Prize and Commendation Prize winners. We also wish to acknowledge all the translators who submitted high-quality entries and encourage everybody to continue to revise and improve their translations. \nWe hope the Korean authors and poets whose work they have chosen to translate will respond positively when asked for permission to publish the completed translations, together with their publishers. It is often more difficult to find a publisher than it is to translate. But that is changing today, with an increasing number of young translators entering the field armed with enthusiasm and energy. These translators, eager readers of literature not only in Korean and English but from around the world, are true citizens of the world. Thank you for your good work in the service of world literature. "

Both mother and baby were healthy.\nIn fact, John was one of four babies delivered at Saint George hospital that afternoon, according to Dr Yacoub, whose nearby apartment was also destroyed by the explosion.\n\"That's made it easy for me to move on as well, I think, or just get over what happened,\" Dr Yacoub said.\n\"Because we were part of something positive that day.\n\"A lot of my colleagues saw horrific things in the ER, but just knowing that you brought life into the world makes it easier to comes to terms with.\"\nWith 182 people killed and 6,000 wounded, as well as four hospitals badly damaged, health workers responding to the blast faced enormous challenges.\n\"I guess we are living again what the doctors used to tell us [about] when they used to work through the civil war,\" Dr Yacoub said.\n\"They would be performing surgeries and deliveries with explosions and bombings and shootings happening around.\n\"But everyone that's spoken to me about the civil war says that whatever you guys lived in the two or three hours when the explosion happened ... was 10 times worse than what they experienced in the civil war.\"\nConcerns raised over trauma suffered by Beirut residents\nFirass Abiad, the manager of Beirut's largest hospital, Rafik Hariri University Hospital, said he was worried about the amount of trauma suffered by Beirut residents.\n'We lost everything': Beirut blast victims recall tragedy\nSearch and rescue operations continue in Beirut after a massive explosion rocked Lebanon's capital, plunging hundreds of thousands of shellshocked citizens into sudden homelessness.\nRead more\n\"One of the aspects that we are seeing in all of this is the severe mental stress that a lot of the people are under,\" he said.\n\"This is easy to miss because for physical things you can see them, you can touch them, but the mental stress can be a bit more challenging to note.\"\nDr Abiad said this was also an issue that had been chronically underfunded in Lebanon.\nEven though most of the population has lived through conflict and unrest, historically Lebanon has only allocated 5 per cent of its health budget to mental health services.\nCounselling is not covered by public health care, nor private insurance.\nMrs Khoueiri says she has been dealing with the trauma around her labour by focusing on her new baby.\nBut she has also contacted the other mothers who gave birth the afternoon of the blast via messaging service WhatsApp, hoping to talk about her experience.\nSo far, they have only been able to exchange pleasantries.\n\"I didn't feel like they wanted to talk or elaborate on this subject now,\" Mrs Khoueiri said.\n\"Maybe they are still in shock or they need time, but we kept the group.\"\nShe feels their reluctance is understandable after a traumatic year in Lebanon.\n\"We were pregnant during COVID-19, we were locked down, we didn't go and see people,\" Mrs Khoueiri said.\n\"The whole pregnancy was already tough and hard and now, in addition, there was this delivery -- and I think it's too much for us.\n\"We have to keep going on and move on for our babies, because this is the time our babies need us the most.\"\nHealth system under immense strain\nNow health workers are dealing with a resurgence of coronavirus.\nIt had already begun in the weeks before the blast but was made worse by the chaotic aftermath when large groups of injured and distressed people gathered around the city.\n\"In the last couple of days the number of cases was above 400 new cases per day,\" Dr Abiad said.\n\"The positivity rate ... it's hovering between 8 and 9 per cent.\nDr Abiad said the number of patients requiring critical beds was also rising sharply across the city.\n\"So for all these reasons, clearly there is an exponential rise in the number of cases in Lebanon,\" he said.\nAs a result of the recent surge in cases, the country has gone into a two-week lockdown to try to lower the infection rate.\n\"We declare today a state of general alert and we need a brave decision to close [the country] for two weeks,\" Health Minister Hamad Hassan told Voice of Lebanon radio on August 16.\nBut Dr Abiad said there were other problems facing the country's health system, including supply shortages.\nAccording to the WHO's regional emergency director, Richard Brennan, an assessment of 55 clinics and health centres in Beirut after the blast found about 50 per cent were \"non-functional\".\nWhile Lebanon's health system was once envied in the region, it has been severely depleted in recent years by the country's financial crisis and an influx of refugees from neighbouring Syria.\n\"When you have a rampant virus, it really tests your system,\" Dr Abiad said.\n\"The system, even before all of this, was really under a lot of stress and barely able to continue.\n\"I'm not sure with all of what is happening this system can endure.\""

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, is providing 10 million such meals for workers in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday. Photo: AFP\n\n\nIf a swap goes ahead, it would be one of very few instances of cooperation in an otherwise deeply frayed US-Iran relationship, which has grown more hostile since US President Donald Trump took office.\n\n\n\"We have stated our readiness to discuss the release of all prisoners without preconditions ... but [the] Americans have not responded yet. It seems to us that Americans are more prepared than before to end this situation,\" Rabiei said, according to the government's website Dolat.ir.\n\n\nBoth countries have called for the release of prisoners because of the new coronavirus outbreak. Iran is the worst hit country in the Middle East, while the United States has reported the highest number of deaths worldwide from the virus.\n\n\nThree Iranian officials told Reuters last week that a prisoner swap between the two countries was in the works. Michael White, a US navy veteran who has been detained in Iran since 2018, is a likely candidate to be swapped. He was released from prison in mid-March on medical furlough but remains in Iran.\n\n\n\"Washington is aware of our readiness and we think there is no need for a third country to mediate between Tehran and Washington for the prisoner exchange,\" Rabiei said. \"However, if the American side agrees, the interest section of Iran in Washington will inform the US of our views on the details, including how and when the exchange will take place.\""

Finish telecom giant Nokia, which scored zero in Chinese 5G radio contracts in 2020, got approximately 4 percent of the work, while Datang Mobile got about 3 percent. \n\n\nAs for Ericsson, the lackluster result was certainly the outcome of market competition -- Ericsson's 5G technologies and equipment have no edge over those of Huawei, ZTE and other contract winners, no matter in terms of quality, energy consumption or price, said the source.\n\n\nMore importantly, it mirrors public attitude toward Sweden's crackdown on Chinese firms, the source said.\n\n\n\"Without any factual basis and conclusive evidence, Sweden has cracked down on Chinese businesses, including Huawei by means of administrative orders, showing its arrogance and wickedness,\" the source said. \"The Chinese people will never accept the behavior of smashing the bowls of Chinese firms while continuing to profit in the Chinese market.\"\n\n\nThe source noted that the Chinese government has repeatedly urged Sweden to correct its wrong decisions and provide an open, equitable, fair and non-discriminatory business environment, thereby avoiding a negative impact on China-Sweden economic and trade cooperation, and Swedish businesses' operations in China. However, Sweden, instead of stopping its wrongful actions, has been arbitrarily walking even farther along the wrong path. \n\n\nA veteran industry analyst, also told the Global Times on Thursday that he believed the drop in share was not only due to the quality issue - there are also political factors.\n\n\nThe Swedish government's hostile attitude toward China and restrictions on Chinese firms make its own firms suffer in China, the analyst said.\n\n\nEricsson's financial disclosure also showed that its sales in the Chinese market plunged in the second quarter.\n\n\nSweden's future China policy moves would be in focus, industry watchers said, warning the Nordic country of the consequences of further cracking down on Chinese firms.\n\n\nThe analyst also said that \"We expect Ericsson's performance in the China market could decline further.\""

        "text": "The Taliban insurgents have become a severe headache for the public and the government. To deal with the increasing insecurity, the public has defied the threats and harsh weather and to cast votes. The turnout was unprecedented. However, the public mandate was not respected. Despite that everyone welcomed formation of the National Unity Government (NUG) in order to see the dawn of peace and stability. Unfortunately, public aspirations were not respected and the national interests became second priority for the government as the NUG leaders remained busy in sorting out their own problems and differences. Their efforts to distribute the power equally have consumed precious time. Yet, they failed to remove the deadlock over key issues such as: appointments of key officials; issuance of electronic national identity cards; parliamentary and district councils' elections; and amendments in the constitution to create post of the Chief Executive.\nThe quest for power by the leaders has affected lives of the public badly. Insecurity has scaled new heights. Fall of Kunduz City to the Taliban again on Monday prove that the government has not learnt from the past mistakes. The provincial council member in Kunduz, Asadullah Saddat, confirmed that the Taliban had overrun the city.  Performance of the current government can be summarized in just three words--failure upon failure. At a time when the Kunduz City and Helmand were on the verge of collapse, the president left the country for Brussels while the chief executive has not made his mind yet. The country is at war but the commander-in-chief is not here. The security forces are giving sacrifices to defend the country, but the leaders are far away from battlefields. Perhaps, they take the Brussels summit more important to be attended by key Afghan officials than paying visits to the insecure areas; otherwise, they would have taken the fragile security situation serious.\nSeemingly, intention of the Taliban is to cause panic by launching coordinated attacks in Helmand and Kunduz. It worked well. It worked well both for the militants and those who ask the NUG leaders to convene the Loya Jirga so the fate of the 'failed government' will be decided to provide relief to the insecurity-hit people.\nThe leaders cannot blame foreign elements for long to cover their mistakes and differences. Despite numerous challenges, the previous government was able to hold control over all major cities. No major city was fallen to the Taliban till establishment of the NUG. People are in their right to demand the Loya Jirga in order either to reject the current government or approve it by amending the constitution. The sooner the fate of the government is decided will be better for the country because the nation cannot afford insecurity anymore."
